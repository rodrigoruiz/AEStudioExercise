# AEStudioExercise

This project is an attempt to implement the exercise specified here https://github.com/agencyenterprise/hiring-developer/tree/39c155be90dd057307810387a1b4a06cf7b94990.

We assumed notes were meant to be local to the browser, so we're using the "localStorage" API.
If those were to be more persistent and global, a server side database would be necessary along with a login system, to make sure each user has access only to its own notes.

To start the app just run:

`npm start`
